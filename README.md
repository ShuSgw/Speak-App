## My web design process

### 1. Planning

**Setting a Goal** - The purpose of building up this website is to showcase my projects, tell visitors who I am, and attract them to stay the website longer.

**Color** - The concept of the webiste is the universe that stands for infinity. Thus, I used dark colors to express the universe and white color to make contrast.

### 2. Design

**Wireframe** - Simple paper wireframe due to its speed and easiness.

### 3. Development

**Coding** - My text editer is VsCode

**Why GSAP** - GSAP is up to 20x faster than jQuery and CSS. Also, there are not much issue cased by cross-browser compatibility.

**Why smoothState.js** - The plugin simply enable to a website to become a single page application with Ajax, so that the website can achieve a beautiful page transition animation with CSS and GSAP.

## Code architecture for CSS

- BEM (http://getbem.com/naming)

### BEM

The Block, Element, Modifier methodology is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS.
**Benefits**

- To improve the CSS legibility due to naming
- To imporove the CSS reusability due to the components component oriented CSS

## Future Improvements

- Using a JavaScript compilete module to make my JavaScript legible.
- Change functions into Objects and delete multiple functions that have similer purposes.
- Understanding SmoothState more and optimize the website's speed.
